# KSP-IPH-2019-TABLE38
Team $@G4(Safety Administrative Guiding Application)

We had attempted to digitalize the Beat Management System of the Indian Police Force. We achieve this by developing a mobile app for the Beat Constable, which is intended to replace the Beat Books and also to keep a track on whether he does his rounds sincerely. We also have developed a web app for the ASI (supervisor) to keep a track on the attendance of the beat constable. 


The tools we've used are:
For the development of the web app:
Python (Flask) for the backend
HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend


For the development of the android app:
MIT App Inventor for the app development
Firebase as the database
Google account linked with all the databases have the username and password as:
Username: ksphackathon123@gmail.com
Password: k$Phackathon123


For the face recognition model, a siamese model was implemented for one-shot learning.
